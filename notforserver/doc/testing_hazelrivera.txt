1. Navigation good, very easy. The chat is really cool, I like that I am talking to people specific to the ad. 
I love how all the ads I posted and all the ads I am searching are all in one page, don't have to switch from page to page.
2. I really like the colour blocks, they navigate my eyes between the major elements of the site.
The logo looks great, and the horizontal gradient is much better now.
Overall (9.5/10), great job! This is so beautiful and easy to use. So easy to add stuff. Very navigable. Just some minor proximity changes, and it's perfect.
The true, true, I would come back to this site all the time, especially bc I know that I can easily pick a lot of the stuff from school.
3. I don't like that the choose location menu drops down when my mouse hovers over it. I know that I want to be looking in Western, If I wanted to go somewhere else, I can just click that element to change locations.
