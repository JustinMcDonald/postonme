SUGGESTIONS
------------------------------------------------
4. thought it will be quite easy to use ; I was not able to log in but once
a few bugs are fixed and improved, the site seems very promising. key
features for easy of use (imo) are the live chat to talk to people
instantly and the expansion of ads (saving time by not having to go to a
new page)

things to fix / change:
- users under live chat on home page could not be clicked on - would be
cool if the user (there as recent activity or something of the like) could
be clicked on for more info / go back to recent post
- *** was not able to sign up for an account --> received error message
"The referenced username does not exist.". probably a glitch in your code
somewhere. see attached screenshot

- should have "no results found" when search query is empty (optional but
nice to have)
- font size for advanced search is very small and hard to read
- from home page --> clicking on relax should go somewhere or lead to a
page with more info about or how to use or something, since the other two
are both functional (i approve of the layout though - pretty cool)

things I liked:
- emailing the person was quite easy --> nice popup
- "Sign up and level up" is pretty catchy --> nice to see that years of RS
/ gaming has made its mark :P
- ability to converse with someone instantly is really cool (could consider
a number as well, although maybe too much info. instant chat is definitely
nice though)
- REALLY like being able to click on an ad to expand it without having to
go to another page ; great step up from kijiji
- enjoyed the sort of relaxed / informal language in popups and
information. for example, the "forgot?" popup text starting off with "No
problem. We'll send you an email..." rather than "an email will be sent to
you" makes it seem more personal and cool --> probably a pretty key
advertising feature, along with it being specifically for the western area.
On a side note, I expect to see this expanded to other universities once it
gets up and running :P
